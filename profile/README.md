# Klamath Science Collaborative GitHub Organization

[The Klamath Basin Science Collaborative](https://klamath-basin-sdm.gitbook.io/doc) is organizing people and processes focused on co-production and integration of knowledge within the Klamath Basin.

The Science Collaborative plans to use decision analytic approaches to collaboratively develop objectives related to water resources and ecosystem management in the Klamath Basin, and open and transparent models for understanding and evaluating these objectives.

## Toolbox

The Science Collaborative uses GitHub to version and share code which includes (1) making data usable and accessible, and (2) Science Collaborative decision support models.

### Data

There are two types of data tools: tools for synthesizing the data landscape and tools for making data useful for modeling and analysis.

- [Data Explorer](https://flowwest.shinyapps.io/klamath-map/): Prior to making data usable and accessible for modeling, we wanted to understand the water and ecological data landscape in the Klamath Basin. This tool is a map of long term water and ecological monitoring efforts in the Basin designed to summarize what data is available where.
- [klamathWaterData](https://github.com/Klamath-SDM/klamathWaterData): We use R data packages to make data available and useful for modeling and analysis. This is a R data package containing water data such as flow, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH at locations within the Klamath Basin.
- [klamathFishData](https://github.com/Klamath-SDM/klamathFishData): We use R data packages to make data available and useful for modeling and analysis. This is a R data package containing fish data such as modeled estimates of adult and juvenile abundance and survival for species such as chinook, coho, and suckers.
- klamathHabitatData: We use R data packages to make data available and useful for modeling and analysis. This is a R data package containing data related to the physical environmental in the Klamath Basin.

### Models

Models will be developed based on the direction of the Science Collaborative.
